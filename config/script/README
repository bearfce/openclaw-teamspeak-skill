# TeamSpeak Server Installation

## Headless Install

To install the TeamSpeak server in a headless environment, use the following command to bypass the UI terms acceptance popup:

```bash
./teamspeak3-server_linux_x86t64/ts3server_minimal_runscript.sh --nox11
```

This adds the --nox11 flag to skip the UI terms popup.
